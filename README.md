Goal: Build a functional, console-based dice game utilizing JavaScript and its best practices.

Technologies: JavaScript

User stories:
DONE - (5 points): As a developer, I want to make consistent commits accompanied with good, descriptive commit messages.
DONE - (10 points): As a developer, I want to come up with a game concept played with dice, ensuring that my game concept is more complicated than “War”. When you have a concept, send it to the instructors via a group Slack message.
DONE - (10 points): As a developer, I want my game concept to be approved by an instructor. This will be done via Slack as mentioned above.
DONE - (10 points): As a developer, I want to have one function capable of “rolling a die” (by generating a random number), regardless of the number of sides.
DONE - (20 points): As a developer, I want my game to have gameplay functionality.
DONE - (10 points): As a developer, I want to utilize six different dice within my game. (Recommended dice are 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided. Different dice may be substituted. No 2-sided die.)

Reminder: There is absolutely no front-end requirement for this project! The game can be ran/played entirely through the console or by using alerts and prompts. Any front-end work should come only after the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the game has been achieved.

1. player gets 3 turns
2. there are 3 rolls per turn
3. the object is to get the highest score
4. at the end of the turn the score is determined by the sum of the pips on the dice that are kept after each roll
5. if the bonus condition is met when the hand is scored, there is one turn of bonus round play
6. the dice used in the bonus round all have different numbers of sides.
7. the bonus score is determined by summing the number of pips on the first 4 dice in the array; the last dice will then be subrtacted from the bonus total.
8. the bonus total will be added to the score for the round.
